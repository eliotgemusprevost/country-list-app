# country-list-app

 The country data is retrieve from RestCountries API [https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all].

## Angular CLI 

The project was generated CLI version 6.1.2.

#### A few notes

 Had a little bit of time constraint to finish both project on time so I focused mostly on delevering something simple that work. With more time could have
 added tests on the service (on which we could add a few feature like retrieve specific country, etc) as well as more test on the countrylist component
 (filter, correctness of information, color format, etc.)
 
Should work as is using those command.
npm install
ng build 
ng serve

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma].

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor].
